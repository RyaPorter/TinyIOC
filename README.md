# TinyIOC

![Ubuntu Latest](https://github.com/RyaPorter/TinyIOC/workflows/Ubuntu%20Latest/badge.svg?branch=master)

TinyIOC is a small lightweight IOC container being developed for general curiosity. 
Currently it only supports the bare basics of registering and resolving types with two lifetimes - Singleton and Transient. Future goals include supporting type names.
